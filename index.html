      I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned <br> were current, if not more so, 
  in the company I joined. I <br> honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

    “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a <br>
  transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
  for <br> the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
  The next 12 <br> weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
  the course, I’ve <br> successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

    “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve <br> never written a line of code. I needed <br> some structure from 
  professionals  <br> who can help me learn programming <br> step by step. I was encouraged to <br> enroll by a former 
  student of theirs <br> who can only say wonderful things <br> about the program. The entire <br> curriculum and staff 
  did not <br> disappoint. They were very hands-on <br> and I never had to wait long for <br> assistance. The agile team 
  project, in <br> particular, was outstanding. It took <br> my learning to the next level in a way <br> that no tutorial 
  could ever have. In <br> fact, I’ve often referred to it during <br> interviews as an example of my <br> developent 
  experience. It certainly <br> helped me land a job as a full-stack  <br> developer after receiving multiple <br> offers. 
  100% recommend! ”

      Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp <br> themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
  learning from <br> their experiences was easy.

  “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The <br> program 
  gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present <br> myself as a capable 
  junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get <br> the personal attention you need from 
  an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”
